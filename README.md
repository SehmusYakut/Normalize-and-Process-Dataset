# Normalize-and-Process-Dataset
R code download .CELL datasets from NCBI website(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds) and normalize them with quantile normalizing method. This R code can normalize only .CELL extension datasets, if process other datasets that include differenet extensions, please configure R code.

Python code take .csv file that created by R code and process them with SVM(Support Vector Machine), Random Forest and Logistic Regression machine learning methods. It also give us some different output to analyse dataset.
