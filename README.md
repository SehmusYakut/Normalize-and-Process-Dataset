# Normalize-and-Process-Dataset
R code download .CELL datasets from the NCBI website(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds) and normalize them with the quantile normalizing method. This R code can be normalized only .CELL extension datasets, if you want to process other datasets with different extensions, please configure the R code.

Python code takes .csv file created by R code and processes them with SVM(Support Vector Machine), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression machine learning methods. It also gives us some different outputs to analyze the dataset.
